       "  'abstract': \"Modeling a user's click-through behavior in click logs is a challenging task due to the well-known position bias problem. Recent advances in click models have adopted the examination hypothesis which distinguishes document relevance from position bias. In this paper, we revisit the examination hypothesis and observe that user clicks cannot be completely explained by relevance and position bias. Specifically, users with different search intents may submit the same query to the search engine but expect different search results. Thus, there might be a bias between user search intent and the query formulated by the user, which can lead to the diversity in user clicks. This bias has not been considered in previous works such as UBM, DBN and CCM. In this paper, we propose a new <i>intent hypothesis</i> as a complement to the examination hypothesis. This hypothesis is used to characterize the bias between the user search intent and the query in each search session. This hypothesis is very general and can be applied to most of the existing click models to improve their capacities in learning unbiased relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that after adopting the intent hypothesis, click models can better interpret user clicks and achieve a significant NDCG improvement.\",\n",

The purpose of this paper is to analyze query suggestion features of three search engines to see if these features introduce some bias into the query and search process that might compromise this trust. The authors test the approach on person-related search suggestions by querying the names of politicians from the German Bundestag before the German federal election of 2017.\\r\\n            \\r\\n            \\r\\n              Design/methodology/approach\\r\\n              This study introduces a framework to systematically examine and automatically analyze the varieties in different query suggestions for person names offered by major search engines. To test the framework, the authors collected data from the Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo query suggestion APIs over a period of four months for 629 different names of German politicians.

Among other effects, the results of the analysis show a small bias in the form that male politicians receive slightly fewer suggestions on “personal and misc” topics. The stability analysis of the suggested terms over time shows that some suggestions are prevalent most of the time, while other suggestions fluctuate more often.\\r\\n            \\r\\n            \\r\\n              Originality/value\\r\\n              This study proposes a novel framework to automatically identify biases in web search engine query suggestions for person-related searches. Applying this framework on a set of person-related query suggestions shows first insights into the influence search engines can have on the query process of users that seek out information on politicians.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Many tasks that leverage web search users' implicit feedback rely on a proper and unbiased interpretation of user clicks. Previous eye-tracking experiments and studies on explaining position-bias of user clicks provide a spectrum of hypotheses and models on how an average user examines and possibly clicks web documents returned by a search engine with respect to the submitted query. In this paper, we attempt to close the gap between previous work, which studied how to model a single click, and the reality that multiple clicks on web documents in a single result page are not uncommon. Specifically, we present two multiple-click models: the independent click model (ICM) which is reformulated from previous work, and the dependent click model (DCM) which takes into consideration dependencies between multiple clicks. Both models can be efficiently learned with linear time and space complexities. More importantly, they can be incrementally updated as new click logs flow in. These are well-demanded properties in reality.</p> <p>We systematically evaluate the two models on click logs obtained in July 2008 from a major commercial search engine. The data set, after preprocessing, contains over 110 thousand distinct queries and 8.8 million query sessions. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the gain of modeling multiple clicks and their dependencies. Finally, we note that since our experimental setup does not rely on tweaking search result rankings, it can be easily adopted by future studies.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This study investigates the impact of collective questions and answers displayed on Search engine result pages (SERP), known as People also ask on searchers' behaviors and beliefs. Two experiments were conducted in which participants were asked to perform health-related search tasks. In both experiments, items in People also ask were manipulated. Experiment 1 focused on the effect of question, answer, and answer's opinion. Experiment 2 focused on the effect of the alternative question, i.e., a question related to the solution that can achieve the same goal as a query. The results revealed the following. (i) Participants issued fewer queries and spent less time on a SERP when People also ask were presented. (ii) Participants were less likely to interact with a SERP when they first encounter a belief-inconsistent answer. (iii) We could not confirm the effect of People also ask on beliefs at the current state. The findings suggest that People also ask might not help mitigate confirmation bias as participants are likely to spend less effort on the search process (i.e., issue fewer queries) when they first encounter a belief-inconsistent answer unlike when they encounter a belief-inconsistent document within the search results. An additional experiment is required to validate that participants who first encounter a belief-inconsistent answer are more likely to alter their beliefs as the number of such participants was inadequate.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"A key driver for next generation web information retrieval systems is becoming the degree to which a user's search and presentation experience is adapted to individual user properties and contexts of use. Over the past decades, two parallel threads of personalisation research have emerged, one originating in the document space in the area of Personalised Information Retrieval (PIR) and the other arising from the hypertext space in the field of Adaptive Hypermedia (AH). PIR typically aims to bias search results towards more personally relevant information by modifying traditional document ranking algorithms. Such techniques tend to represent users with simplified personas (often based on historic interests), enabling the efficient calculation of personalised ranked lists. On the other hand, the field of Adaptive Hypermedia (AH) has addressed the challenge of biasing content retrieval and presentation by adapting towards multiple characteristics. These characteristics, more typically called personalisation ''dimensions'', include user goals or prior knowledge, enabling adaptive and personalised result compositions and navigations. The question arises as to whether it is possible to provide a comparison of PIR and AH, where the respective strengths and limitations can be exposed, but also where potential complementary affordances can be identified. This survey investigates the key techniques and impacts in the use of PIR and AH technology in order to identify such affordances and limitations. In particular, the techniques are analysed by examining key activities in the retrieval process, namely (i) query adaptation, (ii) adaptive retrieval and (iii) adaptive result composition and presentation. In each of these areas, the survey identifies individual strengths and limitations. Following this comparison of techniques, the paper also illustrates an example of a potential synergy in a hybridised approach, where adaptation can be tailored in different aspects of PIR and AH systems. Moreover, the concerns resulting from interdependencies and the respective tradeoffs of techniques are discussed, along with potential future directions and remaining challenges.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To systematically review the evidence for the use of stereotactic radiosurgery or stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy in adult patients with malignant glioma.Key clinical questions to be addressed in this evidence-based review were identified. Outcomes considered were overall survival, quality of life or symptom control, brain tumor control or response and toxicity. MEDLINE (1990-2004 June Week 2), CANCERLIT (1990-2003), CINAHL (1990-2004 June Week 2), EMBASE (1990-2004 Week 25), and the Cochrane library (2004 issue 2) databases were searched using OVID. In addition, the Physician Data Query clinical trials database, the proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (1997-2004), ASTRO (1997-2004), and the European Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ESTRO) (1997-2003) were searched. Data from the literature search were reviewed and tabulated. This process included an assessment of the level of evidence.For patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma, radiosurgery as boost therapy with conventional external beam radiation was examined in one randomized trial, five prospective cohort studies, and seven retrospective series. There is Level I evidence that the use of radiosurgery boost followed by external beam radiotherapy and carmustine (BCNU) does not confer benefit with respect to overall survival, quality of life, or patterns of failure as compared with external beam radiotherapy and BCNU. There is Level I-III evidence of toxicity associated with radiosurgery boost as compared with external beam radiotherapy alone. The results of the prospective and retrospective studies may be influenced by selection bias. Radiosurgery used as salvage for recurrent or progressive malignant glioma after conventional external beam radiotherapy failure was reported in zero randomized trials, three prospective cohort studies, and five retrospective series. The available data are sparse and insufficient to make absolute recommendations. Stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy has been reported as boost therapy with external beam radiotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma in only three prospective studies. As primary therapy alone without conventional external beam radiotherapy for newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients, stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy has been reported in only one prospective study. There were only three prospective series and two retrospective studies reported for patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma.For patients with malignant glioma, there is Level I-III evidence that the use of radiosurgery boost followed by external beam radiotherapy and BCNU does not confer benefit in terms of overall survival, local brain control, or quality of life as compared with external beam radiotherapy and BCNU. The use of radiosurgery boost is associated with increased toxicity. For patients with malignant glioma, there is insufficient evidence regarding the benefits/harms of using radiosurgery at the time progression or recurrence. There is also insufficient evidence regarding the benefits/harms in the use of stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy for patients with newly diagnosed or progressive/recurrent malignant glioma.',\n",

      "    <abstract>Modeling a user's click-through behavior in click logs is a challenging task due to the well-known position bias problem. Recent advances in click models have adopted the examination hypothesis which distinguishes document relevance from position bias. In this paper, we revisit the examination hypothesis and observe that user clicks cannot be completely explained by relevance and position bias. Specifically, users with different search intents may submit the same query to the search engine but expect different search results. Thus, there might be a bias between user search intent and the query formulated by the user, which can lead to the diversity in user clicks. This bias has not been considered in previous works such as UBM, DBN and CCM. In this paper, we propose a new &lt;i&gt;intent hypothesis&lt;/i&gt; as a complement to the examination hypothesis. This hypothesis is used to characterize the bias between the user search intent and the query in each search session. This hypothesis is very general and can be applied to most of the existing click models to improve their capacities in learning unbiased relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that after adopting the intent hypothesis, click models can better interpret user clicks and achieve a significant NDCG improvement.</abstract>\n",

      "              Survey-based studies suggest that search engines are trusted more than social media or even traditional news, although cases of false information or defamation are known. The purpose of this paper is to analyze query suggestion features of three search engines to see if these features introduce some bias into the query and search process that might compromise this trust. The authors test the approach on person-related search suggestions by querying the names of politicians from the German Bundestag before the German federal election of 2017.&#13;\n",

      "              This study introduces a framework to systematically examine and automatically analyze the varieties in different query suggestions for person names offered by major search engines. To test the framework, the authors collected data from the Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo query suggestion APIs over a period of four months for 629 different names of German politicians. The suggestions were clustered and statistically analyzed with regards to different biases, like gender, party or age and with regards to the stability of the suggestions over time.&#13;\n",

      "              By using the framework, the authors located three semantic clusters within the data set: suggestions related to politics and economics, location information and personal and other miscellaneous topics. Among other effects, the results of the analysis show a small bias in the form that male politicians receive slightly fewer suggestions on “personal and misc” topics. The stability analysis of the suggested terms over time shows that some suggestions are prevalent most of the time, while other suggestions fluctuate more often.&#13;\n",

      "    <abstract>Many tasks that leverage web search users' implicit feedback rely on a proper and unbiased interpretation of user clicks. Previous eye-tracking experiments and studies on explaining position-bias of user clicks provide a spectrum of hypotheses and models on how an average user examines and possibly clicks web documents returned by a search engine with respect to the submitted query. In this paper, we attempt to close the gap between previous work, which studied how to model a single click, and the reality that multiple clicks on web documents in a single result page are not uncommon. Specifically, we present two multiple-click models: the independent click model (ICM) which is reformulated from previous work, and the dependent click model (DCM) which takes into consideration dependencies between multiple clicks. Both models can be efficiently learned with linear time and space complexities. More importantly, they can be incrementally updated as new click logs flow in. These are well-demanded properties in reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We systematically evaluate the two models on click logs obtained in July 2008 from a major commercial search engine. The data set, after preprocessing, contains over 110 thousand distinct queries and 8.8 million query sessions. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the gain of modeling multiple clicks and their dependencies. Finally, we note that since our experimental setup does not rely on tweaking search result rankings, it can be easily adopted by future studies.</abstract>\n",

      "    <abstract>This study investigates the impact of collective questions and answers displayed on Search engine result pages (SERP), known as People also ask on searchers' behaviors and beliefs. Two experiments were conducted in which participants were asked to perform health-related search tasks. In both experiments, items in People also ask were manipulated. Experiment 1 focused on the effect of question, answer, and answer's opinion. Experiment 2 focused on the effect of the alternative question, i.e., a question related to the solution that can achieve the same goal as a query. The results revealed the following. (i) Participants issued fewer queries and spent less time on a SERP when People also ask were presented. (ii) Participants were less likely to interact with a SERP when they first encounter a belief-inconsistent answer. (iii) We could not confirm the effect of People also ask on beliefs at the current state. The findings suggest that People also ask might not help mitigate confirmation bias as participants are likely to spend less effort on the search process (i.e., issue fewer queries) when they first encounter a belief-inconsistent answer unlike when they encounter a belief-inconsistent document within the search results. An additional experiment is required to validate that participants who first encounter a belief-inconsistent answer are more likely to alter their beliefs as the number of such participants was inadequate.</abstract>\n",

Over the past decades, two parallel threads of personalisation research have emerged, one originating in the document space in the area of Personalised Information Retrieval (PIR) and the other arising from the hypertext space in the field of Adaptive Hypermedia (AH). PIR typically aims to bias search results towards more personally relevant information by modifying traditional document ranking algorithms. Such techniques tend to represent users with simplified personas (often based on historic interests), enabling the efficient calculation of personalised ranked lists. On the other hand, the field of Adaptive Hypermedia (AH) has addressed the challenge of biasing content retrieval and presentation by adapting towards multiple characteristics. These characteristics, more typically called personalisation ''dimensions'', include user goals or prior knowledge, enabling adaptive and personalised result compositions and navigations. The question arises as to whether it is possible to provide a comparison of PIR and AH, where the respective strengths and limitations can be exposed, but also where potential complementary affordances can be identified. This survey investigates the key techniques and impacts in the use of PIR and AH technology in order to identify such affordances and limitations. In particular, the techniques are analysed by examining key activities in the retrieval process, namely (i) query adaptation, (ii) adaptive retrieval and (iii) adaptive result composition and presentation. In each of these areas, the survey identifies individual strengths and limitations. Following this comparison of techniques, the paper also illustrates an example of a potential synergy in a hybridised approach, where adaptation can be tailored in different aspects of PIR and AH systems. Moreover, the concerns resulting from interdependencies and the respective tradeoffs of techniques are discussed, along with potential future directions and remaining challenges.</abstract>\n",

      "    <abstract>To systematically review the evidence for the use of stereotactic radiosurgery or stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy in adult patients with malignant glioma.Key clinical questions to be addressed in this evidence-based review were identified. Outcomes considered were overall survival, quality of life or symptom control, brain tumor control or response and toxicity. MEDLINE (1990-2004 June Week 2), CANCERLIT (1990-2003), CINAHL (1990-2004 June Week 2), EMBASE (1990-2004 Week 25), and the Cochrane library (2004 issue 2) databases were searched using OVID. In addition, the Physician Data Query clinical trials database, the proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (1997-2004), ASTRO (1997-2004), and the European Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ESTRO) (1997-2003) were searched. Data from the literature search were reviewed and tabulated. This process included an assessment of the level of evidence.For patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma, radiosurgery as boost therapy with conventional external beam radiation was examined in one randomized trial, five prospective cohort studies, and seven retrospective series. There is Level I evidence that the use of radiosurgery boost followed by external beam radiotherapy and carmustine (BCNU) does not confer benefit with respect to overall survival, quality of life, or patterns of failure as compared with external beam radiotherapy and BCNU. There is Level I-III evidence of toxicity associated with radiosurgery boost as compared with external beam radiotherapy alone. The results of the prospective and retrospective studies may be influenced by selection bias. Radiosurgery used as salvage for recurrent or progressive malignant glioma after conventional external beam radiotherapy failure was reported in zero randomized trials, three prospective cohort studies, and five retrospective series. The available data are sparse and insufficient to make absolute recommendations. Stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy has been reported as boost therapy with external beam radiotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma in only three prospective studies. As primary therapy alone without conventional external beam radiotherapy for newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients, stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy has been reported in only one prospective study. There were only three prospective series and two retrospective studies reported for patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma.For patients with malignant glioma, there is Level I-III evidence that the use of radiosurgery boost followed by external beam radiotherapy and BCNU does not confer benefit in terms of overall survival, local brain control, or quality of life as compared with external beam radiotherapy and BCNU. The use of radiosurgery boost is associated with increased toxicity. For patients with malignant glioma, there is insufficient evidence regarding the benefits/harms of using radiosurgery at the time progression or recurrence. There is also insufficient evidence regarding the benefits/harms in the use of stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy for patients with newly diagnosed or progressive/recurrent malignant glioma.</abstract>\n",
